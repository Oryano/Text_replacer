		<h1> "Suzanne" / Leonard Cohen </h1>

		<p>
		SuzanneNoun takes youNoun down to her placeNoun near the riverNoun 
		YouNoun can hear the boatsNoun go by 
		YouNoun can spend the nightNoun beside her 
		And youNoun know that she'sNoun half crazy 
		But that's why youNoun want to be there 
		And she feeds youNoun teaNoun and orangesNoun 
		That come all the way from ChinaNoun 
		And just when youNoun mean to tell her 
		That youNoun have no loveNoun to give her 
		Then sheNoun gets you on her wavelengthNoun 
		And sheNoun lets the riverNoun answer 
		That youNoun've always been her lover 
		And youNoun want to travel with her 
		And youNoun want to travel blind 
		And youNoun know that she will trust youNoun 
		For youNoun've touched her perfect body with your mindNoun. 
		And JesusNoun was a sailor 
		When he walked upon the waterNoun 
		And heNoun spent a long timeNoun watching 
		From his lonely wooden towerNoun 
		And when heNoun knew for certain 
		Only drowning menNoun could see him 
		He said "All menNoun will be sailors then 
		Until the seaNoun shall free them" 
		But heNoun himself was broken 
		Long before the skyNoun would open 
		Forsaken, almost humanNoun 
		He sank beneath your wisdomNoun like a stoneNoun 
		And youNoun want to travel with himNoun 
		And youNoun want to travel blind 
		And youNoun think maybe youNoun'll trust him 
		For he's touched your perfect bodyNoun with his mindNoun. 
		</p>

		<p> 
		Now SuzanneNoun takes your handNoun 
		And she leads youNoun to the river 
		She is wearing ragsNoun and feathersNoun 
		From Salvation ArmyNoun countersNoun 
		And the sunNoun pours down like honeyNoun 
		On our ladyNoun of the harbourNoun 
		And sheNoun shows youNoun where to look 
		Among the garbageNoun and the flowersNoun 
		There are heroesNoun in the seaweed 
		There are childrenNoun in the morningNoun 
		TheyNoun are leaning out for loveNoun 
		And theyNoun will lean that way forever 
		While SuzanneNoun holds the mirrorNoun 
		And youNoun want to travel with her 
		And youNoun want to travel blind 
		And youNoun know that youNoun can trust her 
		For she's touched your perfect bodyNoun with her mindNoun.
