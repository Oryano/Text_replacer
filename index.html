			<h2>Associative replacer</h2>
			<p class = "expl">This is an associative text replacer, Hover over any noun to see the original<br>
			On the right hand of this page is the resault of a manually performed "mashup" using the following technique:<ol>
				<li>Choose randomly a noun in the song</li>
				<li>Turn to the person next to you</li>
				<li>Say the word to the person and wait for a replay</li>
				<li>The word the person replyed is now replacing these nouns in the text</li>
				<li>Repeat until song looses meaning</li>
